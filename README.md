## Generated CouchApp

This repo is a snapshot of the development going on in [The CouchApp generate command.](http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp/tree/master/templates/app/)

It's easier for me to receive patches against couchapp/couchapp. This repo is intended primarily so you can deploy new versions of the example app without needing to upgrade CouchApp.
